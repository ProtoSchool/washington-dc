*******************************

### THIS REPO IS NO LONGER IN USE AND HAS BEEN ARCHIVED.

This repo has been archived as part of the transition to ProtoSchool's new local event leadership model, [announced](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/issues/84) in March of 2020. If this group is still hosting ProtoSchool workshops, they'll be listed on our events page.

**Please visit our [events page](https://proto.school/#/events) to find upcoming workshops near you** and learn more about the groups hosting them. 

**Learn more about [hosting events](https://proto.school/#/host)** under our new model, which makes it easier than ever for newcomers to start hosting ProtoSchool workshops based on our interactive [tutorials](https://proto.school/#/tutorials).
